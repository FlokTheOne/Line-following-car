# Line-following-car
Build a line-following car using an Arduino, IR sensors, and a motor driver. This project guides the car to follow a track by detecting lines via two IR sensors and controlling two motors. The car moves forward, turns, or stops based on sensor input, demonstrating basic robotics and control logic.
